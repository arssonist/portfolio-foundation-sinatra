                          I love writing code, building apps, and learning new technologies. I work on both ends of the stack . My future self intends to learn Swift and develop for iOS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Eventually I intend to use my technology skills to help alleviate global problems such as unemployment, food wastage, and mental health. I am ardently seeking a junior developer role that will help me become the best developer I can possibly be, while achieving my goals along the way.
