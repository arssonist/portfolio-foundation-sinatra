This it the code for my personal website/portfolio! I created this as a place to showcase the projects I've build as well as a place to direct people who might want to learn more about me. It was created using Sinatra, Foundation and Handlebars JS.

I built the server side with Sinatra. Other than a basic server and a few global variables for links I really did not use much of Sinatra's functionality, or write much Ruby.

The UI and page design was done almost completely using Foundation 6. This means the site is nearly 100% responsive, and works well on every mobile device I have tried, except for some weird display problems on iPad. However it does not work on older versions of Safari or IE. This might be a hosting issue as Heroku just throws an error.

All of the templating in the views is done using Handlebars JS. Since there is no database I built out all the UI using JSON and JavaScript via Handlebars.
